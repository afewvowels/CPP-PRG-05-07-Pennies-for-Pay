//   Write a program that calculates how much a person would earn over a period of time
//   if his or her salary is one penny the first day and two pennies the second day, and
//   continues to double each day. The program should ask the user for the number of days.
//   Display a table showing how much the salary was for each day, and then show the
//   total pay at the end of the period. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount,
//   no the number of pennies.
//
//   Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days worked.
